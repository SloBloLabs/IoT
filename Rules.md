What is the best switch point for the phase?

a)
min. 1 phase: 1 * 6A * 230V = 1,38kW
max. 1 phase: 1 * min(20[cbl], 32 [ama]) * 230V = 4,6kW ... 7,36kW

b)
min. 2 phase: 2 * 6A * 230V = 2,76kW
max. 2 phase: 2 * min(20[cbl], 32 [ama]) * 230V = 9,2kW ... 14,72kW

c)
min. 3 phase: 3 * 6A * 230V = 4,14kW
max. 3 phase: 3 * min(20[cbl], 32 [ama]) * 230V = 13,8kW ... 22,08kW

A car will only operate in modes a + b or a + c, depending on number of charging phases.
The number of charging phases is only known after a charging is initiated and determined using nrg-array.
Afterwards calculation can rely on the value during the session.

Keep the phase mode as long as the surplus is below the max. current the active phase mode can provide. (phase mode switch is costly in time)
